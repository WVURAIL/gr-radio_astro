# Examples

The folders `nsf` and `DSPIRA` have GNURadio flowgraph `.grc` files to run programs of two following flavors: 

1. NSF Integrate and Detect softwares that allow for HI measurements and also event detections from cosmic ray detections, developed by Dr. Glen Langston. See [here](https://github.com/WVURAIL/gr-radio_astro/wiki/Nsf-gr-radio_astro) and the [lightwork memo series](https://wvurail.org/lightwork/) for more details. 
2. DSPIRA software developed for and by High School Teachers part of the [NSF funded RET program called Digital Signal Processing in Radio Astronomy (DSPIRA)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1611114) at WVU university from the summers of 2017 to 2021. For more details visit the [webpage](https://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/about/) and the companion website called [dspira-lessons](https://wvurail.org/dspira-lessons/) that has lessons, guides and more material help one to use radio astronomy in a high school classroom. This material is designed by the High School teachers part of this program.
